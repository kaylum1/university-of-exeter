# ECM3412 â€” Nature-Inspired Computation

This module explored algorithms and optimisation techniques inspired by natural systems such as evolution, swarm intelligence, and neural processes.

## ðŸ§  Key Learning Outcomes
- Understood the principles of evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming.
- Applied nature-inspired heuristics to solve complex optimisation problems.
- Compared algorithm performance through computational experiments.

## ðŸ’» Example Project
Implemented a **Genetic Algorithm** to optimise route planning and compared results with traditional search algorithms.
